Libraries:
- Repository of pre-written code segments
- Reusable functions and routines
- Target specific tasks/functions
- Offer flexibility for integration
Examples: jQuery, Lodash, React

Framework:
- Comprehensive software development platform
- Provide foundation and structure for application building
- Handle user requests
- Manage data flow
- Impose architecture
Example: AngularJS, Vue.js

Front-end frameworks:
- User facing
- Leverage HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Create dynamic and interactive user interfaces
Example: React, AngularJS, Vue.js

React:
- Open source JavaScript library
- Developed by Meta
- Interactive user interfaces

Features of React:
- Components
- Declarative Syntax
- Virtual DOM
- One way data binding
- JavaScript XML (JSX)
- Hook Employment

Components:
- Emphasizes reusable UI elements
- Composing independent components
- Encapsulates UI functionality in individual files
- Easy to use withouot duplication

Declarative Syntax:
- UI behavior based on states
- Focuses on behavior
- Manages the underlying DOM

Virtual DOM:
- Generates virtual DOM copies
- Composes to real DOM
- Updates essential segments
- Optimizes performance
- Minimizes DOM modifications

One way data binding:
- Data flows unidirectionally
- Simplifies data management
- Reduce bugs

JavaScript XML:
- Integrates HTML into JavaScript code
- Makes it easier to create and visualize UI components

Hook Employment:
- Handle states
- No need for class components
- Simplify component logic
- Promote code reuse
- Easily manage stateful behavior
