Introduction to build tools:
- CRA tool
-- npx create-react-app app-name
-- Installs unnecessary files and folder
-- Leads to large file size
- Vite tool
-- npm create vite@latest
-- Improved development tool
-- Used with React, Angular, or JSX
-- Bundles code only when required

Folder structure:
Node_modules -> Dependencies through npm and yarn
public -> Static assets like HTML files, images, and fonts
src -> Source code for the React application
main.jsx -> Entry point for the React app
App.jsx -> Root component of the React app
package.json -> Metadata, scripts for running, building and testing
vite.config.js -> Configuration settings for the Vite build tool
.giignore -> Files and folders to be ignored by git
README.md --> setup, instructions, documentation etc.
Index.html -> Entry point for web apps
eslintrc.cjs -> Configuration file for ESLint
